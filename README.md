# FinalProject
Utilizing HTML/CSS, and Javascript, I decided to expand and practice using Javascript- a language I have a hard time understanding due to it's synthax.

I used a tutorial by Gowtham Ti to create a todo list and changed the layout and added a "completed" section highlighting the tasks that were completed. This helps serves users a reminder that they are more than capable of completing their to-do list as they have before.

Some future changes:

- the ability to organize all your to do lists into different sections
- the ability to jot down how much time a certain task took
- Any feedback or comments is strongly encouraged
