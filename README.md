# FinalProject
Utilizing HTML/CSS, and Javascript, I decided to expand and practice using Javascript- a language I have a hard time understanding due to it's synthax.

I used a tutorial by Gowtham Ti to create a todo list and changed the layout and added a "completed" section highlighting the tasks that were completed. This helps serves users a reminder that they are more than capable of completing their to-do list as they have before.

Some future changes:

- the ability to organize all your to do lists into different sections
- the ability to jot down how much time a certain task took
- Any feedback or comments is strongly encouraged

Some things I learned:
- got my hands on mongoDB and it was very interesting to finally be able to utilize data to create a program!
-downloaded tailwindCSS for the first time; seen many people use it and never had the chnace to use it myself 
-I downloaded an extension called ES7+ to use REACT components

Some challenges:
-For some reason, I was unable to run my npm server and I have tried various ways to get through
